    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Community-based, socially responsive peer-led approaches to hepatitis C (HCV) testing and treatment can improve access, increase uptake, and overcome barriers to care. We examined the feasibility of a decentralized mobile peer-led test and treat intervention integrating peer-operated point-of-care HCV RNA testing and peer-facilitated linkage to care.\nMethods: Peers On Wheels (POW) is an observational cohort study of a peer-led mobile model to expand point-of-care HCV testing to people with recent injecting drug use recruited between July 2022 and May 2023 at 11 locations in New South Wales, Australia. The study was co-designed and implemented by a peer-based organisation representing people who use drugs. Participants received incentives, point-of-care HCV antibody (Abbott Bioline) and RNA testing (Xpert HCV Viral Load Fingerstick) performed by peers, same-day receipt of test results (on-site, via phone, text message or upon return to the service), and peer-assisted linkage to care and treatment. The proportion of people accepting HCV testing and initiating HCV treatment were assessed.\nResults: Between September – X 2023, X participants were enrolled. Of these, X (X%) were male, X (X%) homeless, X (XX%) were receiving opioid agonist treatment, XX (XX%) had injected drugs ever and XX (XX%) had injected drugs in the past month. Among those offered an HCV test, XX% (n=XX) accepted testing and XX% (n=XX) were HCV RNA detectable. Among those with current HCV (n=53), XX (XX%) were linked to care and XX (XX%) initiated treatment. Reasons for not initiating treatment included loss to follow-up (n=XX), XX, and XX.\nConclusion: A peer-led mobile model led to a high acceptance of point-of-care HCV testing among people at risk of HCV infection, with XX% initiating treatment. This peer-led mobile model facilitated an expanded reach of testing and diagnosis, but further strategies should be explored to facilitate enhanced linkage to care and treatment.\nKey-words: Open Science, Reproducibility, Quarto, TIER Protocol 4.0, R language, RStudio, Git, GitHub, renv, GitHub Pages.",

    "text": "The World Health Organization has set a goal to eliminate hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as a major public health threat by 2030, with targets to increase HCV diagnoses and treatment, and reduce new infections and liver-related deaths (WHO, 2017). However, despite strong early treatment uptake (Alavi et al., 2019) , annual treatment numbers have declined and data now suggests that for Australia to achieve hepatitis C elimination, testing rates must increase by at least 50% among people who inject drugs (Scott et al., 2020). Increasing uptake of HCV testing and treatment is hampered by lack of appropriate testing modalities and inaccessible models of service provision, limited support along current diagnostic pathways, and exposure to drug-related stigma and discrimination, amplified in key populations, such as people who inject drugs (Gibbs et al., 2021; Grebely et al., 2017; Madden et al., 2018)\nAlthough the availability of point-of-care testing for the detection of active HCV infection in one hour has improved HCV clinical management, globally (Draper et al., 2020; MacIsaac et al., 2024; Shih et al., 2023), significant barriers to HCV testing and treating exist (Grebely et al., 2024). Despite studies demonstrating that point-of-care HCV RNA testing and treatment is associated with increased test acceptability (Bajis et al., 2017), reductions in loss to follow-up and enhanced treatment uptake (Alavi et al., 2019; Iversen et al., 2019), testing and treatment in community-based settings still remains inaccessible to marginalized and underserved populations of people who use drugs (Demant et al., 2023). Although studies have evaluated mobile HCV clinics (Demant et al., 2023; Midgard et al., 2022; Rennert et al., 2024; Ryan et al., 2021), few studies have evaluated a decentralized mobile peer-led test and treat intervention which comprises point-of-care HCV RNA testing performed by peers and peer-facilitated linkage to care.\nIn addition to peer-led strategies to enhance testing, interventions are required to enhance engagement and maintenance in care for people with ongoing injecting drug use (Cunningham et al., 2022). Peer-assisted linkage to care (also called peer-support) across all stages of the treatment pathway has been demonstrated to be an important intervention to facilitate HCV testing, linkage to care/treatment, and maintained engagement in care Treloar et al. (2015)). Peer-assistance at all stages of the cascade of care creates an opportunity for relatedness, knowledge sharing, trust and rapport, and allows for the introduction of wider psychosocial support mechanisms and avenues for health-promotion (Crawford & Bath, 2013; Satinsky et al., 2021; Surey et al., 2019, 2021).\nThis study presents the results of an interventional cohort study evaluating a decentralized mobile peer-led test and treat intervention integrating peer-operated point-of-care HCV RNA testing, peer-assisted linkage to care.\n\n\n\n\nAlavi, M., Law, M.

    "text": "This study examined the feasibility of a peer-led mobile model to expand access to point-of-care HCV testing and treatment among people at risk of HCV infection in the community. Overall, the HCV antibody prevalence was XX% and HCV RNA prevalence was XX%. Awareness of infection status was suboptimal, particularly among those with current infection. The proportion of people linked to care and treatment were XX% and XX%, respectively. This study demonstrates a high engagement in testing and supports the feasibility of community-led testing by peer-workers. These data highlighting the feasibility of implementing a peer-led, mobile decentralized test and treat intervention with peer-operated point-of-care HCV RNA testing will guide clinical practice to implement similar models internationally. This study supports health policy by providing evidence to support the inclusion of peer-operated point-of-care HCV RNA testing in local, national, and international viral hepatitis strategy guidelines. However, further work is needed to understand barriers and enablers of HCV testing and treatment to design interventions to support linkage to HCV treatment.\nHCV antibody and RNA prevalence in this study was XX% and XX% respectively. These estimates are similar to other studies in community settings across Australia (ref). consistent with othother estimates from similar community-based settings acriss Australia derived in similar populations in. Among people weho inject drugs, either within the last six months or ever, the HCV antibody prevalence was XX% and the HCV RNA XX%.\nThe treatment uptake observed in this study (XX%) is lower than in studies evaluat pingint-of-care HCV RNA testing in mobile clinics (74%) (O’Loan, et al., 2021), supervised consumption facilities (89% - XX) (Macisaac, et al., 2021), NSP (63-84%) (Howell, et al., 2022; Shilton, et al., 2022), community-based settings (79-91%) (Draper, et al., 2021; Ralton, et al., 2021), and prisons (93%) (Sheehan, et al., 2021). This study had peers leading several aspects of the study, ncluding stakeholder engagement, study enrollment, point-of-care HCV antibody testing and HCV RNA testing using the GeneExpert system. While having peers positioned to perform these roles had numerous benefits, doing so also came with it’s own set of challenges\nThis study has limitations. Given that participants were recruited from sites within New South Wales, Australia, the results of this study may not be applicable to all HCV treatment settings and populations of people who inject drugs. Unfortunately, information on the number of people approached for this study was not collected, so it was not possible to assess the reach of the study in terms of the proportion of people who were approached and accepted HCV testing. Further, participants received AUD$20 cash reimbursement for receiving an HCV test, AUD$20 for initiating treatment (if HCV RNA detected) and AUD$20 for completion of treatment, which may have provided additional incentive to return for follow-up and led to an increased treatment uptake in the study. Despite the renumeration, treatment uptake in this study was suboptimal, with rates below other studies providing mobile, peer-supported point-of-care HCV RNA testing (Demant et al., 2023; Midgaard et al., 2022; O’Loan, et al., 2021; Ralton, et al., 2021). Rates of treatment uptake were impacted by the complex landscape of service providers across New South Wales, many also part of Australia’s National Point of Care Program, and the need to ensure appropriate treatment pathways across different models of service provision. There were also logistical and financial constraints, that limited the number of participants recruited into the study and resulted in a smaller than anticipated sample size and limited the power to investigate factors associated with detectable HCV RNA (which is why these results are presented only descriptively).\nThe findings from this study have important clinical, research, and policy implications. In order to achieve hepatitis C elimination, innovative approaches to improve testing and treatment among people who inject drugs are required. We demonstrate the success of a real-world model of care incorporating fingerstick HCV RNA PoCT and access to DAA therapy in engaging high-risk individuals in hepatitis C care. Such models of care allow higher numbers of people living with hepatitis C to be diagnosed, cured, and avoid the long-term sequelae of hepatitis C associated liver disease. The demonstration that a decentralized, peer-led mobile testing and treatment model is feasible has the potential to guide clinical practice for point-of-care HCV RNA testing for management of HCV infection. Furthermore, our findings support incorporating recommendations for increased availability and adoption of PoCT technology into national and international clinical guidelines, hepatitis C elimination strategies and health policies. Recently, the Australia government, along with industry sponsors and key stakeholders have funded the implementation of the National Hepatitis C Point-of-care Testing Program, which aims to provide scaled-up point-of-care antibody and RNA testing across a range of community-based sites throughout Australia (Grebely et al., 2023b). In addition, findings offer guidance around how peer-support and peer-led point-of-care testing is integrated into health service delivery. Although several mobile HCV clinics are operational within the National Australian HCV Point-of-Care Testing Program (Grebely et al. 2023), a randomised controlled trial comparing peer-led HCV point-of-care testing, peer-support throughout the treatment pathway, and standard of care among PWID accessing community-based health and support services with embedded health economic evaluation will provide critical information on the effectiveness, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of the most effective testing strategy in community-based settings. Such programs will be crucial to ongoing identification of key facilitators and barriers to testing and treatment uptake, as well as inform the feasibility of future models of care incorporating PoCT across a range of global settings. Further, drawing on implementation science and undertaking process mapping will provide insight into key intersections across the diagnostic pathway that contribute to suboptimal outcomes, promoting a reflective and responsive approach that will help to overcome identified barriers. Furthermore, our findings support incorporating recommendations for increased availability and adoption of PoCT technology into national and international clinical guidelines, hepatitis C elimination strategies and health policies. Recently, the Australia government, along with industry sponsors and key stakeholders have funded the implementation of the National Hepatitis C Point-of-care Testing Program, which aims to provide scaled-up point-of-care antibody and RNA testing across a range of community-based sites throughout Australia (Grebely et al., 2023b)",

    "text": "Model of care development\nThe Peers on Wheels project was led, developed, and implemented by a peer-based organisation representing people who use and inject drugs, the New South Wales Users and AIDS Association (NUAA) through a co-design process including researchers (The Kirby institute, UNSW), health policy makers (New South Wales Health), service providers, and people who use drugs. Project governance included a steering committee consisting of representatives from each organisation that met fortnightly to design the study protocol, approve plans for data analysis and provide implementation oversight.\nThe campaign schedule and local logistics were organized by NUAA. Site locations for testing campaigns were identified and selected by peers with local expertise and knowledge (part of the NUAA peer network) in consultation with local health districts. Criteria for site location selection included the identification of localised areas where people who inject drugs could be reached or were known to visit and where accessible HCV testing and treatment was suboptimal. Knowledge generated through consultation with local peers and networks of people who use drugs was leveraged to identify fieldwork locations prior to each campaign. Site locations were also informed by the need to set up a welcoming area for people to understand what was happening, and to accommodate testing equipment and treatment processes. In addition to peer workers from Sydney, a local peer that was part of the NUAA peer network who was familiar with the local area was employed for the duration of the fieldwork within a particular location to ensure local expertise and knowledge.\nSubstantive work for each campaign was carried out to prior to visiting each site location. This included regular communication with key personnel within the local health district (e.g. service managers, health promotion workers) and those involved in the management of HCV care (e.g. nurses, physicians, specialists) to develop pathways to enhance linkage to treatment.\nThe peer-led mobile model was delivered through a van and included a range of personnel, including a peer project coordinator (managed site logistics on testing days), 1-2 peer point-of-care testing operators (who were trained in point-of-care HCV antibody testing and RNA testing using a GeneXpert instrument), a local peer, and at least one person from the local health district. For the purposes of this project, “peers’ were defined by a range of characteristics including, people with lived and living experience of drug use (including injecting drug use) and viral hepatitis, connection with a drug-user social identity, and relatedness to communities of people who use drugs (Greer et al., 2016). Prior to implementation of the project, project staff (i.e. peers) were trained to undertake point-of-care HCV antibody and RNA testing through theoretical and practical training (online and remotely) provided by the International Centre for Point-of-Care Testing at Flinders University. In total, four peers were trained as operators of the GeneXpert instrument and as qaulified to administer the Bioline and Insti",

Fieldwork campaigns ranged from three to five days at a given location with multiple campaigns being held within each local health district. Fieldwork occurred in a range of spaces and services, including pharmacies where people accessed drug treatment, district hospitals, car parks in front of community services, community service hubs, parks in the community, allied services and private locations proposed by participants (e.g., private houses).

    "text": "3.3 Procedures\nThe POW Project was advertised generally two weeks preceding the events with posters in local clinics and other services (including the details of when and where the campaign was occurring), referral through health services (e.g. wallet cards), website and NUAA communication channels and via word of mouth. Recruitment within each campaign spanned 1 to 5 days at each site location concurrent with defined pathways for linkage to HCV care and treatment. The mobile and flexible nature of the model often allowed for multiple sites to be visited in a single day.\nEnrolment assessments included peer-administered behavioural questionnaires on tablet computers (demographics, behavioural risk, and previous HCV testing and treatment) and peer-administered point-of-care HCV antibody testing (Abbott Bioline HCV, City, Country) and/or point-of-care HCV RNA testing [Xpert HCV Viral Load Fingerstick Assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, United States; lower limit of quantification 100 IU/ml, upper limit of quantification 108 log10 IU/ml; 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity)]. A peer collected a capillary whole-blood sample from participants via a fingerstick (Safety Lancet, Super Blade [Order Number 85.1018], Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) using procedures recommended by the WHO (WHO, 2010) and collected into a 100-uL minivette collection tube (Minivette POCT 100μl K3E [Order number 17.2113.101], Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Immediately following collection, 100 uL of capillary whole blood was placed directly into the Xpert HCV VL Fingerstick assay cartridge (lower limit of quantification of 100 IU/mL; Cepheid, Sunnyvale) for on-site HCV RNA testing. The cartridge was loaded into the GeneXpert instrument which uses real-time PCR (rt-PCR) technology that enables the quantification of HCV RNA levels (Cepheid, 2019). The time to result for Xpert HCV VL Fingerstick testing is 58 minutes. All Xpert HCV Viral Load assay testing were performed on a clinic-based GeneXpert R2 6-colour, 4 module machine (GXII-2-L System, GeneXpert Dx software v4.6a; Cepheid, Sunnyvale) operated as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Cepheid, 2019).\nInitially, point-of-care HCV RNA testing was immediately performed for all participants (Month XX, XXXX to Month XX, XXXX). However, after a review of data demonstrating a lower-than-expected prevalence of current HCV infection during the first two campaigns (XX site locations), the protocol was revised in Month XXXX so that all participants without a history of HCV treatment received point-of-care HCV antibody with reflex point-of-care HCV RNA testing and participants who had previously received treatment received immediate point-of-care HCV RNA testing.\nWhile waiting for the HCV RNA test result, participants could access food and refreshments, sterile injecting equipment, naloxone, sexual health resources, and harm reduction supplies. During this time, a peer would engage with the participant about available services offered by NUAA such as their online NSP shop with state-wide postal delivery. Nominated staff from the respective LHDs were provided to support and assist with testing on the day. All participants were compensated at completion of an HCV antibody or HCV RNA test (AUD$20 cash), initiation (AUD$20 cash) and completion (AUD$20 cash) of treatment.\nParticipants with detectable HCV RNA were offered a clinical assessment with a nurse or appropriate h ealthcare professional to assess suitability for DAA therapy and linked to a peer support worker when such support was available. Participants deemed not suitable for treatment under this simplified model of care were referred for follow-up through standard of care. NUAA’s Treatment Assisted Pathway Consent process (Model of Care) is an important component of this treatment pathway approach whereby NUAA obtained consent to maintain contact and assist the participant in treatment navigation, treatment initiation, and treatment completion.\nArrangements were put in place with a local pharmacy to facilitate streamlined dispensing of DAA therapy. Following clinical assessment and a decision to initiate DAA therapy, the project PI would contact a physician via telephone to arrange a script and an email would be sent to the pharmacy to allow medication dispensing (with a hard copy of the script delivered the next day). The medication was either directly dispensed to the client at the pharmacy or the nurse or peer would pick up the medication from the pharmacy for collection at the NSP by the client.\nA dedicated peer worker provided education and engagement. This peer played a pivotal role in the study and was responsible for several components including facilitating health promotion activities, leading engagement in testing as people were accessing services (e.g., people accessing pharmacies for dosing as part of opioid agonist treatment), providing a bridge between participants and clinical staff at the service, providing expertise and support for the completion of research survey, and providing ongoing support for participants who initiated treatment through weekly communication and follow-up (most often via telephone).",
