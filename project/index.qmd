## Abstract {.unnumbered}

**Background:** Community-based, socially responsive peer-led approaches to
hepatitis C (HCV) testing and treatment can improve access, increase uptake, and
overcome barriers to care. We examined the feasibility of a decentralized mobile
peer-led test and treat intervention integrating peer-operated point-of-care HCV
RNA testing and peer-facilitated linkage to care.

**Methods:** Peers On Wheels (POW) is an observational cohort study of a
peer-led mobile model to expand point-of-care HCV testing to people with recent
injecting drug use recruited between July 2022 and May 2023 at 11 locations in
New South Wales, Australia. The study was co-designed and implemented by a
peer-based organisation representing people who use drugs. Participants received
incentives, point-of-care HCV antibody (Abbott Bioline) and RNA testing (Xpert
HCV Viral Load Fingerstick) performed by peers, same-day receipt of test results
(on-site, via phone, text message or upon return to the service), and
peer-assisted linkage to care and treatment. The proportion of people accepting
HCV testing and initiating HCV treatment were assessed.

**Results:** Between September â€“ X 2023, X participants were enrolled. Of these,
X (X%) were male, X (X%) homeless, X (XX%) were receiving opioid agonist
treatment, XX (XX%) had injected drugs ever and XX (XX%) had injected drugs in
the past month. Among those offered an HCV test, XX% (n=XX) accepted testing and
XX% (n=XX) were HCV RNA detectable. Among those with current HCV (n=53), XX
(XX%) were linked to care and XX (XX%) initiated treatment. Reasons for not
initiating treatment included loss to follow-up (n=XX), XX, and XX.

**Conclusion:** A peer-led mobile model led to a high acceptance of
point-of-care HCV testing among people at risk of HCV infection, with XX%
initiating treatment. This peer-led mobile model facilitated an expanded reach
of testing and diagnosis, but further strategies should be explored to
facilitate enhanced linkage to care and treatment.
